<br>
  <b>BuildAfrica.org is my blog/project which focuses primarily on the convergence of the two passions in my life: technology and Africa.</b>

<br><br>

My name is Matt Berg. I was born in small village in Cameroon and grew up in Dakar, Senegal in West, Africa. I believe that technology, when used appropriately, can make a difference in people’s lives and I’ve been been fortunate to be able to spend the majority of my career focusing on this.
<br><br>
Currently, I serve as the Director of the Modi Research Group | Africa based in Nairobi, Kenya. I have been part of the <a href="http://modi.mech.columbia.edu">Modi Research Group</a> at Columbia University, led by Professor Vijay Modi, for the past seven years. We build software to help improve development through data informed decisions.
<br><br>
Prior to that, I had the honor of serving both as Geekcorps volunteer in Dakar then as the director of Geekcorps Mali program in Bamako, Mali. I have an MBA in International Business (with a minor in Rugby) from <a href="http://www.thunderbird.edu">Thunderbird</a> in Glendale, AZ. I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at <a href="http://knox.edu">Knox College</a> in Galesburg, IL. Both schools are a testament that it is possible to get an incredible education while having a great time.
