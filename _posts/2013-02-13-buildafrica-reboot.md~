BuildAfrica.org has admittedly been ideal for a long time.  I experimented in shifting my blogging to a tumblr site at [mattberg.org](http://mattberg.org) but quickly became a bit frustrated with tumblr. As part of a personal quest, to see how much of my life I can use [github](http://github.com/mberg) to manage I decided to use this as a chance to learn Jekyll and reboot my blog.

Upon the advice of many, I've decided to go back to using [buildafrica.org](http://buildafrica.org) as my primary blog as I've used it for over a decade and represents what I am about.  [mattberg.org](http://mattberg.org) might possibly be used as a personal reference site to host my CV, etc.  We'll see.

Finding time to write has been the biggest culprit.  Recently, I moved back to Africa and am now based in Nairobi, Kenya where I'll be for the foreeseable future.  My experiences here, I hope will inspire me to write more.

The site design is still a very much a work in progress. For now, I'm just using a fork of Zach Holman's Jeykll theme called [Left](https://github.com/holman/left). I decided to host this as a static site on S3 after some struggles with github page configurations.  To do this I highly recommend following this great [tutorial](http://vvv.tobiassjosten.net/development/jekyll-blog-on-amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/).

So for now my inner geek is happy. I can manage all my site content in github and do all work via the command line. :)  Check back later for hopefully some actual content.
