[Matt Berg - Millennium Villages Student Research Showcase](http://vimeo.com/4061711) from [Earth Institute](http://vimeo.com/ei) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Here is a brief talk I gave at a recent research showcase at Columbia.Â  In it I discuss how we brought Internet connectivity to Ruhiira our rural community in Uganda using a large wifi network that we put in place with the help of [Inveneo](http://www.inveneo.org).  The network is currently being used to connect about 5 clinics, 3 schools and several other community institutions to the nearest Internet connection 35KM away.  As a local intranet, the network is adding tremendous value by enabling free VOIP calls between sites and is also being used by the clinics to facilitate a central medical records system.

In the future, I will try and provide a much more detailed overview of this project but for now it provides a glance at how wifi can be used to bring connectivity when commercial options are not currently available.
