  * [Nice Interview](http://www.nhpr.org/node/25400) by Sean Blaschke on New Hampshire Public Radio on the Columbia/UNICEF Malawi Malnutrition Monitoring pilot using [RapidSMS](http://www.rapidsms.org)

	
  * Useful [ICT4D Calendar ](http://gkpnet.org/events/calendar/calendar.do)by GKPNet

	
  * Great story by [Subsarahska](http://subsaharska.maneno.org/eng/articles/tnp1244522736/) on the DR Congo Inland Fiber cable.  Love the part about Kabila going himself to state that the cable was made out of glass and worthless to steal.  It then goes on to explain how earlier 75KM of copper cable was stolen.. in one night.

	
  * WhiteAfrican makes an [impassioned argument](http://whiteafrican.com/2009/06/06/hurdles-of-high-tech-entrepreneurs-in-africa/) on how to support high-tech entrepreneurship in Africa and sheds some interesting light on how the new [Gmail Google Preview](http://whiteafrican.com/2009/06/09/gmail-preview-starts-in-africa/) feature was inspired by Google Employees who experienced the glory of an Ethiopian Cyber Café

	
  * [Maker Faire Africa](http://makerfaireafrica.com/) dates are set for August 14-16th in Accra.  They are actively looking both for [makers](http://makerfaireafrica.com/call-for-makers/) and sponsors.  There is an option on their website to make individual, small donations if you want to help.

	
  * Interesting post on [Twitter Data](http://twitterdata.org/): an open proposal for embedding data in twitter messages.  Includes some interesting ideas that could also apply to SMS.

	
  * Last but not least, [AfroPop's Summer Concert Schedule](http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/885).  Some great African groups coming through the States and Canada this summer that arent' to be missed.
