One of the real highlights thus far at [Maker Faire Africa 2009](http://makerfaireafrica.com/) has been the presence of [William Kamkwamba](http://williamkamkwamba.com/). William is a remarkable young inventor from rural Malawi, who at the age of 14, built his first windmill out of scrap parts (including his father's bike) after learning about one in a book.Â  William's simple message of not letting your goals be defined by constraints is inspirational and resonated particularly powerful with the other African maker's in attendance at Maker Faire.

Expect to hear more from William this year as he is about to release a book, [The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind](http://www.amazon.com/Boy-Who-Harnessed-Wind-Electricity/dp/0061730327), which comes out September 29th.  I expect it to be very popular as his is a story that particularly deserves telling.
